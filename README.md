# Comparing perfomance of different classifiers

## Overview

This project is a Jupyter Notebook project that demonstrates the use of state-of-the-art classifiers—**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, and **Logistic Regression**—to analyze the **Breast Cancer dataset**. Additionally, it implements an **Advanced Combinatorial Refinement (ComRef) Method** to evaluate and potentially enhance the classification performance.

## Features

- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive data analysis and visualization.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, and **Logistic Regression** classifiers.
- **Combinatorial Refinement (ComRef) Method** for advanced model analysis.
- Performance evaluation on the **Breast Cancer dataset**.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook** or **Jupyter Lab**
- Dependencies list = [scikit-learn]

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
    cd repository-name
    ```

2. Start Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3. Open the `*.ipynb` notebook in the Jupyter interface.

## Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the project directory.
2. Open the notebook file `ProjectName.ipynb`. (Open whichever file you want)
3. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to:
   - Load and preprocess the **Breast Cancer dataset**.
   - Train and evaluate models using **KNN**, **SVM**, and **Logistic Regression**.
   - Apply the **ComRef method** to analyze the performance.
   - Visualize the results.

## Example Output

Here is an example of what you might see after running the notebook:

- **Model Accuracy**: Provides the error rate for each classifier.
- **Refinement Analysis**: Demonstrates the impact of the ComRef method on model performance.
- **Visualizations**: Includes plots for data distribution, model performance metrics, etc.
